# Project_4_Financial_Stock

# BACKGROUND

In this project, we will be collecting a dataset from the yahoo finance, and using a python script which has been initialised, trained and used to evaluate our model. 

# INSTRUCTIONS

This project has been broken down into four parts

- Part 1: Extracting the data
We have extracted our Data from yahoo finance and can be accessed through this link -

- Part 2 : Using python and sklearn to initialise, train and evaluate a model
 Our Data was loaded using a python script and sklearn, we have been able to initialise the dataset, deciding on using LSTM model as this was the best choice for a financial stock data.

- Part 3 : Data Model Optimisation which shows iterative changes in model performance 
The Model optimisation and evaluation process shows iterative changes on our model selected which has also resulted in changes in performance These changes have been saves in a csv file in the output folder.

- Part 4 : All predictions and overall performance has been printed and displayed at the end of the script and saved as a csv file. 

- Part 5 : Tableau visualisation of our outcome and data .
